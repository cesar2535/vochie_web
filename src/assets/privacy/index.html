    <h1>Vōchie Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information by Vōchie. As we update and expand our service, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing our website or otherwise using our service, you consent to our information practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We receive and store information, including personal information, about you and your use of our service. This information is gathered in a number of ways, including when you enter it on our website and from interactions with our service. Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact you. Non-personal information is information that does not permit direct association with you. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. You can choose not to provide personal information we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal information we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal information will prevent us from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you interact with us, we may ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and ability to improve your service. For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you as well as information from other sources, as permitted by law. We use this information, for example, to process your registration and to communicate with you. We might from time to time also use your e-mail address to send you news you have requested, as well as messages about new Vōchie features, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys and other correspondence concerning our service. If you no longer want to receive marketing communications via email or postal mail, simply access the emails in question and click the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We keep track of your interactions with us and collect information related to you and your use of our service, including but not limited to your online activity, title selections and correspondence as well as Internet protocol addresses, device types, unique device data, such as device identifiers, operating systems and related activity. We use this information for such purposes as determining in which country you are located, so that we may provide localized content, enforcing our terms, providing recommendations we think will be enjoyable, personalizing the service to better reflect particular interests, enumerating your streaming time, determining your Internet service provider, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests, and otherwise enhancing or administering our service offering for you and other users. We also provide analysis of our users in the aggregate or otherwise in anonymous form to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, consumption habits, commentary, reviews and other information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vōchie partners with companies serving advertisements for companies whose products we believe will interest our users. In conjunction with these partners, we send promotional announcements and/or serve web-/mobile-based advertisements on their behalf, as permitted by law.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your information within the Vōchie family of companies. The Vōchie family of companies that access your information will follow practices that are consistent with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. In addition we use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies, to provide infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize our web pages, provide customer service, analyze and enhance data, including users' interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your information. We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order to allow participation, will require your information be shared with third parties. For example, we may partner with companies that offer incentives, such as additional rewards, if you sign up or otherwise utilize their service(s). In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. By participating in such joint promotions or programs, you consent to our sharing of your information. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vōchie also reserves the right to disclose personal information if we reasonably believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Vōchie, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transferring of assets, we reserve the right to transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      The Vōchie service and/or website may sometimes contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. While we endeavor to associate with reputable websites and services, Vōchie cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites and services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Vōchie service.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Vōchie service, however, while individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian, and subject to our Terms of Use.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
    <p>

      As you interact with our service, we and our service providers may place cookies on your device. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your device from a web server and stored on your system for record-keeping purposes. In general, cookies can make services more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular device.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to cookies, we and our service providers use a variety of other technologies, including pixel tags (web beacons), clear gifs, or other technologies built into our application software or the Vōchie website, to gather information on how users interact with our service. These cookies and other technologies can help personalize the service for you and help associate your interactions with our service to other information within your account. They can show us, for example, popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information that can be used to improve, operate and monitor our website and other aspects of our service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If your browser is set to not accept any cookies, you will not be able to use the Vōchie website.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Vōchie takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our Product and/or Service, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Vōchie service.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Vōchie account. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Vōchie -ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you fail to log out and deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account information.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      As we update and expand our services, we may make changes to this policy. You should check back for updates to this policy from time to time. You acknowledge that your assent to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy subsequent to any changes made following your initial consent as well as, your use of the Vōchie website or continued use of our service after our posting of changes to this policy, means that you agree to be bound by such changes. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will supersede all previous versions.
    </p>

    <h2>Transfer of Information and International Users</h2>
    <p>
      Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using Vōchie, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide services to us). You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country.
    </p>

    <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions concerning your account, please contact Customer Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is effective as of 1 January 2015.
